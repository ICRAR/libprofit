Language Bindings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bindings exist to wrap libprofit into different languages.

At the moment of writing the following two are available:

* `pyprofit <https://github.com/rtobar/pyprofit>`_:
  a Python wrapper for libprofit.
* `ProFit <https://github.com/asgr/ProFit>`_:
  A package for R that wraps libprofit and performs high-level
  profile fitting against an input galaxy.

Additional language bindings can be easily added in the future if required.
